# Markdown Editor

## About

This is my personal markdown editor for my blog.

## TODOs

1. Set up the GraphQL client to fetch the posts.
2. Create carousel or list UI to go through various posts.
3. If a post is selected, its contents should open up in the markdown
   preview section as well as the input.
4. We should also be able to edit these posts and will require a new mutation
   on the backend to modify the post through a PUT request.
5. We should also be able to DELETE a post if needed. So we have to create a
   mutation for that.
6. We should also have a confirm modal before any request for modification is sent
7. Modify backend endpoint for creating post to use a mutation rather than
   using a REST endpoint.
